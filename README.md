  This app was created for people who enjoy reading and need to kill some time.  StoryTime is filled with stories submitted by the users themselves, and it's completely anonymous.  It doesn't have to be a story, it can be anything at all: A joke, a secret, etc. Upon logging in, a user is presented by a random story. By clicking on the story the user can continue reading the story or click any of the top stories listed. Stories can be added by the user by clicking the Add Story button and they can view/delete their stories by clicking the My Stories button.

  Technology Used:
    React, Redux, Mongoose, Express, Node.
